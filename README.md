# Heisenberg's Bicycle
#Quantum Game Jam 2021

Game Developer / Programmer : Andy Dodson
Visual Artist : Noora Heiskanen
Quantum Physicist : Victoria Sánchez Muñoz

Developed As part of the Quantum Game Jam 2021 to demostrate a Quatum concept.

Quatum Concept? 
In a nutshell Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (1927). 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle
  "The more precisely you know your position the less you know about your velocity" or
  "The more precisely you know your velocity the less you know about your position"
  
  This is implated is a fun game as a demostration of uncertainty principle, that can be played by all.
  Inspired by our Visual Artist for the backstory :
  
  The game takes place in a park, Heisenberg having bought his flowers 
  must find his way to the picnic spot. 
 
 So at each turn you select either direction or velocity and the other elemet is then chosen at random and you ahve to try and make your way to the picnic spread
